# The-Prince42

The Prince42 is a handwired, low-profile, wireless split keyboard. The impetus for this project were the lessons learned from the Prince54. I wanted something that was a bit moore compact, had less external wires, and had an easier to replace microcontroller. It also has a pretty minimal and compact tenting solution, which means my wrists are more protected on the go.
